# BikePath

This is a hobbie project that I'm using my DataCamp skills in python to ETL into a dataframe and perform analysis on.

Future State:
How cool would it be to see a map of melbourne and see a blink every time a bike went past a counter?
How many people are recorded at different areas and disappear from the next likely stop?  What are the possibilities for those people?  Stop at the shops?  Go an alterative or more dangerous/non-bike path route?

Code: Python
Start Date: Sep-21
Re-Start Date: Mar-22

Issues:
1. Max speed doesn't look high enough at 15.92.  Average is 20.99 which is OK.
2. Need to zoom in on months to better see the data

Control:
Version 0.1 - 12/03/22 - Added commentary around problems with data.

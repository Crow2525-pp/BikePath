# BikePath

This is a hobbie project that I'm using my DataCamp skills in python to ETL into a dataframe and perform analysis on. 

Code: Python
Start Date: Sep-21
Re-Start Date: Mar-22

Issues:
1. Max speed doesn't look high enough at 15.92.  Average is 20.99 which is OK.
2. Need to zoom in on months to better see the data

Control:
Version 0.1 - 12/03/22 - Added commentary around problems with data.
